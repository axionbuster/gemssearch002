## Puzzle Data Format

### Input Files (`caseN.txt`)
```
1               # Number of test cases
6 8             # Grid dimensions (rows cols)
@...#@          # Grid data with symbols:
.#....          #   @ = gems
......          #   # = walls  
...#..          #   * = target
#..@.#          #   % = special gems
......          #   . = empty space
```

### Solution Files (`caseN_outM.txt`)
```
Test case 1:
yes             # Solvable (yes/no)
Initial state:
[grid]          # Starting puzzle state
Step 1: Apply gravity Down
[grid]          # Grid after step 1
...             # More steps
Won!            # Success indicator
```

## Contributing

This project is currently in active development. The codebase is designed to be:
- Modular and component-based
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Accessible and responsive
- Easily extensible for new features

## Data Integration

Currently using mock data for demonstration. To integrate with actual Haskell solver output:

1. Implement file reading in `PuzzleParser.loadPuzzleCase()`
2. Add API endpoints for puzzle data if needed
3. Update data types as needed for additional puzzle formats
